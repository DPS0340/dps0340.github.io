---

[Programming languages, Part a](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)를 동료 리뷰만 남겨둔 채로 [사실상 수료](2020-11-12-plt-parta-complete.md)한 뒤, 처음으로 완강한 코세라 강좌를 수료증 없이 끝낸다는게 살짝 아쉬워서 재정 지원을 신청하게 되었다.

나는 이렇게 했다.

연 소득: 300 달러

수강료를 얼마까지 결제할 수 있습니까?: 0 달러

재정 지원을 신청하는 이유는 무엇인가요?:

I'm poor CS Student in south korea - currently i'm 20. I have no money and my school's lecture is not so good, so i want and prefer to listen coursera lectures which is about computer science, programming language theory, system programming, computer architecture, machine learning basic, database system and management and design.

It is very helpful to me, and assignment and grading, certificate is important for me at least.

But i'm student, of course i have no job now and i think will no job during university, but it means no incoming money per months. I want to study in coursera, but using parent's money to study is quite strange and feeling bad for me because i am mature and can work(at least legally), so i think having financial aid which is becoming very helpful for me.

If i could get financial aid, as you see, i listened many lectures and submitted assignment, i'll focus on coursera lecture of course.

이 강좌를 수강하면 귀하의 경력 목표를 달성하는 데 어떤 도움이 되나요?:
```
I think yes.

Programming language theory (also known as plt) has becoming important part outside academic area in software development - functional programming is booming like meme and i like it too. I had dream about CS graduated school.

And i also heard about SICP and mit AI labs - it looks like pyramid or ivory tower in programming language theory, of course, in whole CS. And now i'm dreaming about coursera.

Which is very awesome place giving high quality lecture for every people. Now i'm talking to career, so, Returning to career, when i finished the lecture, I will get certificate, and place it on my linkedin and github.

Github is interesting and passionate space in software development, and having certification is will be not only very interesting on managers in corporation, buy also effecting my career and resume, may be getting a job! If this process is able without money, why i would not? I'll very appreciate if the aid is approved. Would you?
